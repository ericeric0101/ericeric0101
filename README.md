# 👋 Hi, I'm Ren West  

### 🧬 From Biomedical Researcher to AI Builder  

I started my journey in molecular biology — exploring RNA biology and diagnostics — and gradually transitioned into the world of **AI-powered automation**.  
My experience in clinical diagnostics and IVDR compliance taught me how precision and regulation matter, while my curiosity in AI showed me how automation can *transform complexity into simplicity*.

## 💡 My Value

### 1️⃣ Automated qPCR Primer Design System  
I developed a complete pipeline that automates qPCR primer design — integrating  
**UCSC genome mapping → Primer3 → in silico PCR → GC content & SNP validation**.  
This system helps technicians **save over 50% of their time** in primer validation workflows.

### 2️⃣ AI-driven Compliance & Trading Projects  
- **HealthAdShield** – an AI-powered *nutrition ad compliance tool* built with Gemini CLI, Claude, and Codex.  
  Inspired by my work in a diagnostics company, I wanted to help marketing teams navigate **IVDR-like compliance** effortlessly using AI.  
- **DeFi Auto-Trading Bots** – I built several **crypto trading bots** (perp-spot arbitrage) with a ~53% win rate, integrating real-time sentiment and news analysis.  
- **n8n Workflows for AI & Market Intelligence** – automated pipelines to track key AI and crypto news from X, ensuring I never miss critical market updates.

## 🎯 My Goal till 2026  

By 2026, I aim to build **HealthAdShield** into a **profitable SaaS** platform serving global marketing and healthcare companies —  
leveraging AI to make regulatory compliance **faster, smarter, and less painful**.  

Ultimately, I plan to **launch a company** dedicated to helping teams in the nutrition, biotech, and marketing sectors achieve compliance with ease.
